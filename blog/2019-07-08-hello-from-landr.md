Hello from Landr
================

Hey there! We're excited to kickstart this project's blog! We want to grow
Landr into the best way to get a website with little overhead, so that creators
out there can focus on what they do best, and leverage Landr to present their
work in a beautiful way.

The plan is for this blog to contain mostly micro-posts describing how things
are going, brainstorm some crazy ideas out loud, and tell everyone about the
additions we're making to the framework in a way that is more conversational
than a bunch of commits in a pull-request.

To stick to the plan, I would like to report that the core engine of Landr has
been fully implemented, and that we built prototypes for things around a
website that are as important as the website itself such as analytics, SEO
friendly headers, favicons, robots.txt, you name it!

The next steps will be to start using the engine to create a professional
looking website, and the first project to get it will be, of course, Landr! The
first website will probably be the hardest, but I'm sure things will ease out
as we go!

If you are reading this blog post, you might have already figured out that we
are prototyping a blog engine on top of Landr, and you would be spot on! We've
seen projects successfully rely on microblogs as a better way to tell the story
of a project, and we hope that Landr and other projects using Landr will take
this advantage as well!

Stay tuned!
