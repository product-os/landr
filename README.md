  conventions, and makes use of them fully. Build a great repository and get a
  great website for it. Its a win-win

Motivation
----------

Creating a website for a project is hard and time-consuming. Yet, a great
website is one of the best ways to promote a project. Landr aims to capture our
experience presenting a wide variety of open source projects on the web, so
that having a website that can compete with your favourite massively popular
open source project is not only possible, but comes with zero overhead.

Examples
--------

The Landr website is of course based on Land! You may also enjoy the following
sites:

- https://www.balena.io/etcher/ - Flash OS images to SD cards & USB drives,
  safely and easily
- https://www.balena.io/fin/ - A board for fleet owners
- https://www.balena.io/os/ - A host OS tailored for containers, designed for
  reliability, proven in production
- https://www.balena.io/open/ - Open source software to manage connected IoT
  devices
